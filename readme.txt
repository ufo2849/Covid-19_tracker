4. What were the changes from the Midterm plan to the current version?
- Added sorting for total cases, deaths, and recovered
- Added date selection function for daily cases
	Note: Originally, we intended for the user to know the covid cases for a particular country for the current day in comparison to the previous day.
		However, we soon realized the API has no data on the current day until the next day so instead we opted for the user to be able to search
		between two valid time periods.

5. How do you run the code?
Nothing special, just open the index.html file while having internet access to connect to the API.
